#### **SIMD data**

SIMD is the Scottish Government's [Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/), a measure which identifies local areas where multiple deprivation is concentrated. The latest SIMD was published in 2020. The next SIMD update is expected in 2026.

The charts show the area deprivation profile of each constituency. Constituencies are made up of small areas with populations of 500-1,000 household residents called "Data Zones", which are all ranked across Scotland from most (rank 1) to least deprived (rank 6,976). SIMD is based on a range of indicators in seven domains: Income, Employment, Health, Education, Housing, Crime, and Access to Services (= rurality).

Charts show SIMD deprivation overall, and deprivation in each of the seven SIMD domains.

The **local share** is the share of areas (Data Zones) within the constituency that are among the most deprived 20% areas in Scotland. 

A local share of 0% means none of the Data Zones in this constituency are among the most deprived 20% across Scotland. A local share of 0-20% (in green) means that deprivation is less concentrated in this constituency compared to Scotland overall. A local share of more than 20% (in purple) means that deprivation is more concentrated in this constituency compared to Scotland overall. A local share of 100% means all Data Zones in this constituency are among the most deprived 20% in Scotland.
