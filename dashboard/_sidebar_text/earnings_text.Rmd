#### **Earnings data**

The charts show weekly median gross earnings of all employees (full-time or part-time). Data is collected by the Office for National Statistics each April via the [Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/latest). The statistics cover employees only and exclude self-employed earnings.

The shaded areas show measurement uncertainty. Time series data is available in cash terms (also called nominal terms) and in real terms, which means it is adjusted for inflation.

Data is available on a council-area level, but not on Scottish Parliament constituency or region level. This page includes council areas that are within or overlap with the selected Scottish Parliament region.

Gaps in the data reflect missing values, usually due to small sample sizes.
