#### Earnings data

The charts show median gross earnings of employees (without adjusting for inflation). Data is collected by the Office for National Statistics each April via the [Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/latest). The statistics cover employees only and exclude self-employed earnings.

Data is available on a council-area level, but not on Scottish Parliament constituency or region level. This page includes council areas that are within or overlap with the selected Scottish Parliament region.

Gaps in the data reflect missing values, usually due to small sample sizes.
