#### Labour market data

- **Employment rate** - The proportion of 16-65 year-olds who are employed or self-employed
- **Unemployment rate** - The proportion of 16+ year-olds who are currently unemployed, i.e. they are looking for work
- **Inactivity rate** - The proportion of 16-65 year-olds who are currently not employed or self-employed and are not actively looking for work.

The data is updated quarterly by the Office for National Statistics via the [Labour Force Survey](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/regionallabourmarket/september2023). The shaded areas show measurement uncertainty (where available). Missing data is shown as gaps. Due to small numbers, unemployment rates are not available on a constituency-level.
