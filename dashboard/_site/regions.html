<h4><strong>Earnings data</strong></h4>
<p>The charts show median gross earnings of employees (without adjusting
for inflation). Data is collected by the Office for National Statistics
each April via the <a
href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/latest">Annual
Survey of Hours and Earnings</a>. The statistics cover employees only
and exclude self-employed earnings.</p>
<p>Data is available on a council-area level, but not on Scottish
Parliament constituency or region level. This page includes council
areas that are within or overlap with the selected Scottish Parliament
region.</p>
<p>Gaps in the data reflect missing values, usually due to small sample
sizes.</p>

<h4><strong>Labour market data</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employment rate</strong> - The proportion of 16-65 year-olds
who are employed or self-employed</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment rate</strong> - The proportion of 16+ year-olds
who are currently unemployed, i.e. they are looking for work</li>
<li><strong>Inactivity rate</strong> - The proportion of 16-65 year-olds
who are currently not employed or self-employed and are not actively
looking for work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employment and Inactivity data is updated quarterly by the Office for
National Statistics via the <a
href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/regionallabourmarket/september2023">Labour
Force Survey</a>. The shaded areas and error bars show measurement
uncertainty (the 95% confidence interval) where available. Missing data
is shown as gaps. Due to small numbers, unemployment rates are not
available on a constituency-level.</p>
<p>Unemployment (claimant count) estimates are updated monthly via the
Office for National Statistics <a
href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/ucjsa">nomis data portal</a>.
This experimental series counts the number of people claiming
Jobseeker’s Allowance plus those who claim Universal Credit and are
required to seek work and be available for work.</p>
